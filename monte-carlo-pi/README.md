# Monte Carlo Method of Estimating Pi

This week's Brain Candy was inspired by this post:

[How Mathematicians Used A Pump-Action Shotgun to Estimate Pi](https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/how-mathematicians-used-a-pump-action-shotgun-to-estimate-pi-c1eb776193ef)

This method of calculating pi is called the Monte Carlo Method or a Monte Carlo simulation. The Brain Candy this week is to use pseudo-random numbers to calculate pi using the Monte Carlo Method. If you need a bit of help with the math the medium post above or Wikipedia can help you out.
